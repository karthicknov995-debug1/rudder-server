# RudderStack Server Workflows

This document describes common workflows in the RudderStack Server system.

## Data Flow Workflow

The main workflow in RudderStack Server is the flow of data from sources to destinations:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Client devices send data to the Gateway component using SDKs or APIs
   - The Gateway validates the incoming requests and stores them in JobsDB
   - The Gateway sends an acknowledgment back to the client

2. **Data Processing**:
   - The Processor retrieves jobs from JobsDB
   - The Processor applies user transformations to the events
   - The Processor applies destination-specific transformations
   - The Processor filters events based on rules
   - The Processor stores the processed events in RouterDB

3. **Data Routing**:
   - The Router retrieves processed events from RouterDB
   - The Router routes events to their destinations
   - The Router handles retries and failures
   - The Router updates the job status in RouterDB

4. **Data Warehousing**:
   - For warehouse destinations, the Warehouse component retrieves events
   - The Warehouse component transforms events into warehouse-compatible formats
   - The Warehouse component loads data into warehouses
   - The Warehouse component tracks sync status

## Configuration Management Workflow

RudderStack Server uses a backend configuration service to manage sources, destinations, and other configuration aspects:

1. **Configuration Retrieval**:
   - The Backend Config component retrieves configuration from the backend service
   - The Backend Config component caches the configuration locally
   - The Backend Config component notifies other components of configuration changes

2. **Configuration Subscription**:
   - Components subscribe to configuration changes
   - When configuration changes, components update their internal state
   - Components adapt their behavior based on the new configuration

3. **Source and Destination Management**:
   - Users configure sources and destinations through the RudderStack UI
   - The backend service stores the configuration
   - RudderStack Server retrieves the configuration and applies it

## Error Handling Workflow

RudderStack Server has robust error handling mechanisms to ensure reliability:

1. **Job Failure Handling**:
   - If a job fails during processing, it is marked as failed
   - Failed jobs are retried based on retry configuration
   - After maximum retries, jobs are moved to the error database

2. **Destination Failure Handling**:
   - If a destination is unavailable, events are queued for retry
   - Retries follow an exponential backoff strategy
   - After maximum retries, events are marked as failed

3. **System Failure Recovery**:
   - If the system crashes, it recovers from the last known state
   - Jobs in "executing" state are reprocessed
   - The system ensures no data loss during recovery

## Monitoring and Observability Workflow

RudderStack Server provides comprehensive monitoring and observability:

1. **Metrics Collection**:
   - Components emit metrics about their operation
   - Metrics include throughput, latency, error rates, etc.
   - Metrics are tagged with relevant dimensions (source, destination, etc.)

2. **Logging**:
   - Components log important events and errors
   - Logs include contextual information for debugging
   - Log levels can be configured based on needs

3. **Tracing**:
   - Distributed tracing is used to track requests across components
   - Traces help identify bottlenecks and performance issues
   - Traces provide end-to-end visibility into request processing

## Deployment Workflow

RudderStack Server can be deployed in various configurations:

1. **Single-Instance Deployment**:
   - All components run in a single process
   - Suitable for development and small-scale deployments
   - Simplest deployment option

2. **Distributed Deployment**:
   - Components run in separate processes or containers
   - Components can be scaled independently
   - Suitable for large-scale deployments

3. **Kubernetes Deployment**:
   - Components run as separate Kubernetes deployments
   - Horizontal scaling based on load
   - High availability and fault tolerance

## Development Workflow

For developers working on RudderStack Server:

1. **Local Development**:
   - Clone the repository
   - Set up dependencies (PostgreSQL, etc.)
   - Run the server in development mode
   - Make changes and test locally

2. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for new functionality
   - Run integration tests to ensure components work together
   - Run end-to-end tests to validate the entire system

3. **Contribution**:
   - Fork the repository
   - Create a branch for your changes
   - Submit a pull request
   - Address review comments
   - Merge changes after approval
